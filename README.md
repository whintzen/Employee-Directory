# :office_worker: Unit 19 React Employee Directory  :woman_office_worker:

## Concept
Employee Directory is an application that is built using React.  When the application is rendered, it displays a list of employees by Name, Phone, Email and DOB (Date of BirthDOB).  This application can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on Name.  The user can also search for an employee in the search box by typing the name.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## User Story
```
  As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```md
  Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

  The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
```

## Instructions
  * Open a terminal and run these commands to set up the environment files `npm install`, `npm run Axios`, `npm install react-router-dom`, `npm install bootstrap` and `npm i moment react-moment -save` to create the node_modules folder and to add additional information.  
  * Run `npm start`, this connect you to the PORT 3000 and also open the Employee Application in the browser.

  ## How the App Works
  * Once the App opens, it will display a list of employees and above this list is a Search box.   You can start typing the first name of the employee you would like to see information on, and as you type employees with similiar letters in their name will first appear, until the employees first name is spelt out.  Please note that you can get more than one employee with the same first name.  You may not have to spell out the full name in order to find the employee.
  * You can also sort the file by clicking on the first Name label.  This will sort the file in ascending or decencending order.  Please note that each time you refresh the page you will get a different list of employees.
